        <p class="p-tag">Having a mental health assessment gives your doctor a picture of the way you think, feel, reason and remember. The mental health test assesses your emotional wellbeing via a series of questions and also includes a physical examination.

        As a priority your doctor will determine if you are at risk of hurting yourself or others. For children, the mental health assessment will be tailored to the child's age and stage of development.</p>
